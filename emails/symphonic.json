    "body": "Hi Chris and Avery,\n\nLoved Symphonic Labs’ approach of intelligent systems into everyday life — I admire the human-first product design!\n\nI’ve been following Symphonic Labs since you won Buildspace S4 — in fact, I was the other Canadian winner (built the app for Parkinson’s)!\n\nSymphonic Labs <> Pavi Crossovers:\n- Healthcare: Parkinson’s monitoring\n- Adaptive AI: Hitch drone project\n- Agentic AI: Real-time AI adaptation and RL systems\n\nAction: Would you be open for a quick chat? I understand you’re incredibly busy but I’d love to pick your brain and show how I can add value to the team (my portfolio includes healthcare, drones, ML, etc).\n\nP.S. Check out Stanford’s new ReAct framework for reasoning + action. Might interest you!\n\nCheers,\nPavi"
