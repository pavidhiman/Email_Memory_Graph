Congratulations!\n\nUnfortunately, we're not hiring interns for the summer…first year or otherwise on our engineering team. Should we decide to open up a position, I will be sure to reach out. I'd recommend you reach out to Alex Reichenbach, our former colleague at Matic who's doing a startup on Agentic AI… they may be hiring and may have an opening for you.\n\nGood luck. We sincerely wish you the best — keep up with your hustle/persistence and you will go places!\n\nBest Regards,\nMehul"
